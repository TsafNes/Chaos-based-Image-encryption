This is a project in cryptography that involves implementing image encryption using various chaos maps 
and comparing their merits based on key sensitivity, adjacent pixel autocorrelation and intensity histograms. 
The chaos maps implemented were - Arnold cat maps, Henon maps and Logistic chaos maps.
